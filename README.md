# UFOs

## Project Overview 

This project focuses on building a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly to display information about UFO sightings. Users will be able to filter the UFO sightings table based on multiple criteria such as the event date, city, state, country and shape.


## Results


User can re-initialize the page by clicking on the navbar at the top. User enters the desired date, then the user enters the desired city, he user then enters the desired country, and finally the user enters the desired state and shape observed.

## Summary 

The main limitation is that 
the user needs to know the exact city that they want to search. It is very difficult to tell unique events apart since the data spans many years. To better this analysis being able to filter the proximity to a particular location, this would increase the usability since users could then find all sightings within a desired distance of a identified location.
